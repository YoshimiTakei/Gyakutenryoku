		<p>The Senbatsu members for the next CD are chose through fan votes. Members of an Idol group are going to be ranked based on their popularity.ー  I think both the members and the fans have accepted, or more like have become used to it now, but the event that has taken place once per since 2009 known as the 「Senbatsu Sousenkyo」, is cruel.</p>

		<p>Akimoto-san, this is too unpredecented.</p>

		<p>Thankfully, thanks to everyone’s support, since the first Sousenkyo, my rank has kept going up.</p>

		<p>In the beginning, even though I appeared in a PV, I received about a 2.5 second cut which was turned out to be like a “Find Sashihara!” situation but thanks to my rank at the Sousenkyo going up, I now properly appear for over a minute.</p>

		<p>And in 2012, I was fourth place at the 4th Sousenkyo. 67,339 votes. I really, really couldn’t believe it. But.</p>

		<p>The 4th Sousenkyo tallying event was on June 6th.</p>

		<p>Ten days later, I was transferred to HKT48.</p>

		<p>In this chapter, I was talk about the thing that has been the biggest pinch in my life so far.</p>

		<h4>I Planned on Quitting AKB48</h4>

		<p>I was contacted regarding an article published about me by a certain weekly magazine on a Monday with a “Waratte Iitomo!” live broadcast.</p>

		<p>In the 48 Group, there is a rule called “Renai Kinshi”*</p>

		<p>There’s an article saying I did something that would break this rule during my time as Kenkyuusei……</p>

		<p>I blacked out.</p>

		<p>That night was the AKB48 National Tour with the concert in Chiba so of course, there was no time for rest. I gave my best performance but my tears wouldn’t stop. Because I thought about how I wouldn’t be able to stand on stage with everyone anymore.</p>

		<p>In the case when there is clear evidence that the rule has been broken, the management would have to give some sort of decision.</p>

		<p>Suspension, demotion to Kenkyuusei, withdrawal from activities.</p>

		<p>As for me, I thought about quitting AKB48. I felt really sorry to all the fans who supported AKB48 and I didn’t want to be a nuisance to the other fans. I told this to Akimoto-san as well. And when I did.</p>

		<p>“I understand. Only those who truly want to cling onto the entertainment industry should stay.”
When I heard those words, I was finally able to temporarily stop all thoughts that were going into a negative direction. Rather than the feelings of the fans that were supporting AKB48, I thought of the feelings of the fans of someone like me and thought about the meaning of the actions I was about to do.</p>

		<p>Because of an article about me was published, the fans would be worried about me without a doubt. And amidst everything, if I suddenly graduate AKB48, then leave the entertainment industry, there would be nothing more sadder than that.</p>

		<p>The thought of Kamei Eri crossed my mind. I loved Kamei-chan but then she suddenly left Morning Musume (December 2010). At the same time, she left the industry.</p>

		<p>I was in such shock that I thought my life was over.</p>

		<p>However, Kamei-chan had no choice to graduate due to poor health conditions. For me, it’s going to be because of just one article. Graduating, then leaving entertainment beacuse of that, is definitely not good at all.</p>

		<p>The new single that I got fourth place in at the Sousenkyo through everyone’s efforts hasn’t even gone on sale and they haven’t even seen me sing at the fourth place position yet.
If I was them, I’d want to see it.</p>

		<p>If I was them, I’d want to see her stay and not leave.</p>

		<p>The next day, I told Akimoto-sensei,</p>

		<p>“I want to continue working hard in AKB48”</p>

		<h4>The Sudden Transfer to HKT48</h4>

		<p>I hid the fact that the magazine with the article was to be released on Thursday and continued activites as I normally would.</p>

		<p>However the night before that day, Miichan (Minegishi Minami) and Takamina (Takahashi Minami) seemed to notice that I was acting strange and invited me out to dinner. When I told them about the article, they held a party at a karaoke place to cheer me up and sang me many songs like 『 <a href="https://youtu.be/rtZLe6T3Dh0">Makenaide</a>』. For three hours. AKB48 is just amazing, it made me glad to be a part of it.</p>

		<p>On the Friday of that week, I was to appear live on 「All Night Nippon」in the form of being called into the episode that was originally mean to feature Akimoto-san.</p>

		<p>At the satart of the show, I gave an apology to all my fans for manking them worried.</p>

		<p>Afterwards, Akimoto-san said the following words: </p>

		<blockquote>“Starting tomorrow, you will be Sashihara Rino from HKT48.”</blockquote>

		<p>…...I didn’t understand.</p>

		<p>AKB48 has three sister groups within Japan. SKE48 in Nagoya, Sakae (began activites on the autumn of 2008), NMB48 in Osaka, Nanba (began activities on the autumn of 2010), and HKT48 in Fukuoka, Hakata (began activities the autumn of 2011).</p>

		<p>The “youngest child” of the 48 Groups, HKT48, at the time only had first generation members and hadn’t even released their debut single. They didn’t have many interactions with AKB48 so I barely knew any of their names. I’m sure that not just me, but the other members and the fans were in the same situation as well.</p>

		<p>I was to be transferred to that group, making me the oldes with the group at 19 years old (at the time).</p>

		<p>I was told by Akimoto-san to go “contribute”. He continued, “ ‘I have broke one the 48 Group’s rules’. When I thought about what that person should do to make the 48 Group fans forgive her, I thought, ‘It must be contributing to the group as a whole’”. The greatest contribution would be to build the hype of the entire 48 Group by transferring to HKT48 who just started their activities and growing the hype there.</p>

		<p>“At this rate, even if you get fourth place and spend the year as you normally would, your popularity will not rise any higher. I don’t think there’s anything more interesting that you transferring and working hard in HKT48.”</p>

		<p>Perhaps maybe, my current situation isn’t a pinch, but a chance at an opportunity. Or more like, I have no choice but to think of this as an opportunity.</p>

		<h4>A Change in Attitude</h4>

		<p>After going to sleep and waking up on the next day, I felt completely refreshed.</p>

		<p>Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that I won’t reflect on my actions, I just start to feel more better quickly. I’m good at finding the flip side of things.</p>

		<p>If you try looking for them really hard, it can be found anywhere. At first when I was transferred to HKT48, I felt really down.</p>

		<p>But since AKB48 has many surprises, it toughened me mentally. No matter how terrible things are, what’s decided is decided. If so, then there’s no time to be apprehensive. Find the good sides of things.</p>

		<p>“There’s a ton of good food in Hakata”, “You can save up a lot of airline miles”, “The moms in Oita can come see her concerts.”</p>

		<p>I also imagined something like this as well.</p>

		<p>“Rather than staying in AKB48 in the state I’m in right now, aren’t there other inspirational things or experiences that would help me grow even more?”</p>

		<p>I think I was right.</p>

		<p>Changing your attitude during difficult situations and always facing foward makes finding the flip side of things much easier to find. I think that the flip sides that you find are easier to turn into a reality.</p>

		<h4>Don't Spout Out Negativity</h4>

		<p>After transferring to HKT48, the first day of the theater show where I perform together with the members was decided. July 5th, 2012. I had other work elsewhere and the my time for lessons was limited.</p>

		<p>As the date drew closer, I told my manager, “I want to schedule all the time I have until the concert for rehearsals. I don’t want to be doing interviews asking me about how my transfer is going.”</p>

		<p>I didn’t want words like “I’m reflecting on my actions” to leave my mouth anymore. To begin with, reflecting isn’t something you can see with your eyes, or rather, it’s hard to communicate. I felt that the only way to prove that, “I, Sashihara Rino, will work hard as an HKT48 member now and to the future”, in a more tangible manner was on the stage.</p>

		<p>Also, even if you ask me, “We’re about to begin, how are you feeling?”, the only thing I’m able to say is, “I will do my best so that everyone can accept me” with my head facing downwards. I knew what I had to do and I was feeling a little uneasy about the first day concert but the fans may have been more uneasy than I was. Even then, if they see me looking all depressed, then they’ll be even more uneasy.</p>

		<p>If this was the interview after it was over, then I can look up and say, “We finished off on a high note! I will continue to do my best!”. They’ll be able to see me in high spirits.</p>

		<p>I don’t think saying negative things in front of other people is a good thing because it puts everyone else in a negative mood and that negative mood will only come back at you.</p>

		<h4>Not Looking at the Internet When Feeling Negative</h4>

		<p>At around this time, the thing where I can say to myself "Good Job Sashihara", was stopping myself from checking the Internet.</p>

    <p>I didn't look at sites like 2Channel or Matome* sites one bit.</p>
    
    <p>If I checked the Internet after the article came out there would also be things that would make me feel that I did something and it'd only make me feel worse.</p>
    
    <p>I easily imagined the most terrible thing that was written about me to date. But since I never checked, I have no way of knowing.</p>
    
    <p>When things get rough, I can imagine that there are a lot of people that go on the Internet and look for things that make them feel better or give them courage but I think the tougher things get, the more that hurtful words tend to get to people. When you look at the negative things when you're in a negative mood, you only swell up with more negativity.</p>
    
    <p>That's why I decided to not check the Internet at all, and I didn't check it once at all.</p>
    
    <p>I think I made the right decision.</p>

    <h4>Because Everyone Accepted Me</h4>
    
    <p>And so, the final decision closed on the first day of the theater concert.</p>
    
    <p>At that time, the only things that were left in me were enjoyment and motivation. To be honest, the only thing that I remember after my transfer to HKT48 was decided are only happy things.</p>
    
    <p>At the very beginning, the HKT48 members were indeed shocked though. I think it's only natural. Normally you'd be surprised if you did all the things with only other people in the same generation as a group and then all of a sudden, a senpai joins the group.</p>
    
    <p>Even though I'm fine with it, Miichan told me that from the HKT48 member's point of view, I'm probably like (Shinoda) Mariko to them and I can see what she meant by that. To be honest, I was filled with anxiety.</p>
    
    <p>But all of the HKT48 members are young and in a good way, they were all children. They're cheerful, energetic, and pure. They welcomed me as if I were the "the transfer student from Tokyo."</p>
    
    <p>They actively wanted to get to know me more. I think that if this was any other group, things might have been different.</p>
    
    <p>I'm thankful to all the people in Kyushu that accepted me. There were countless people who said to me "Welcome" or "Welcome back." I'm from Oita so I can understand why they might say "welcome" but hearing "welcome back" was so refreshing and it made me so happy.</p>
    
    <p>After the performance of the first day concert, I had some work for a TV Station based in Fukuoka and everyone was really nice.</p>
    
    <p>Because everyone accepted me, I naturally started to feel that here is where I wanted to do the biggest things possible.</p>

    <h4>The Greatest Change Given by the Biggest Pinch</h4>
    
    <p>June 8th, 2013. It was my first tallying event for the Sousenkyo after the transfer.</p>
    
    <p>I was aiming for fourth place. I figured that if I was able to maintain the same spot as last time, that meant that everyone had acknowledged me.</p>
    
    <p>And then it happened.</p>
    
    <p>First place.</p>
    
    <p>150,570 votes.</p>
    
    <p>I was so surprised that I stopped breathing. And there were so many votes.</p>
    
    <p>I still vividly remember the view from the stage and the yells as my name was called for first place and to come forth and give my speech.</p>
    
    <p>A good portion of those yells were "Why is it Sashihara!" Either way, 70,000 people were shocked by a 20 year old girl who isn't even that cute.</p>
    
    <p>I became an Idol when I was in third year of middle school to get away from my hometowm. And it has now expanded into a situation I would have never thought was possible at the time.</p>
    
    <p>I could feel the supporting cheers from every vote like they were chances given to me saying, "Do your best one more time!"</p>
    
    <p>In events like handshaking events, there were many people who told me that they understood that I was doing my best for HKT48 so they voted for me. For those people as well, I have to "contribute" even more. I want to make the entire 48Group much more exciting from Hakata.</p>
    
    <p>I began to feel that they way from the bottom of my heart once more after receiving first place.</p>

    <h4>I Became Stronger</h4>
    
    <p>I feel that my heart has gotten much stronger than before by transferring to HKT48. Or well, I had no choice but to become stronger.</p>
    
    <p>I am the oldest within HKT48 and a senpai so I had to become someone that will lead everyone. I began to think that if I can't get myself together, then the group also won't be able to.</p>
    
    <p>As an Idol, it's a disadvantage. A more unreliable member would seem much cuter and seeing the weak parts of someone makes one want to support them. As as person who's popularity comes from being a hopeless "hetare", I feel that it's even more so the case.</p>
    
    <p>But I can't show my weaker parts anymore. I am already no longer "hetare" From now on, I have to live as a strong person.</p>
    
    <p>It would be much appreciated if you could take interest in that strength from now on.</p>
