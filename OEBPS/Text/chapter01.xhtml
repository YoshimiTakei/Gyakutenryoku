  <div class="paragraphtext">

	<p>First, let me introduce myself.</p>

	<p>My name is Sashihara Rino, born on November 21, 1992, currently 21 years old, and my hometown is Oita-ken, Oita-shi. My nickname is “Sasshi” or “Sashiko”.</p>

	<p>I’m a member of HKT48’s Team H, and HKT48 is a sister group of AKB48 where we have our own theater in Hakata and perform most of our activities. I also currently double as HKT48 Theater Manager.</p>
	
	<p>I was originally an AKB48 member. When I was a third year in junior high, I passed the “AKB48 2nd Kenykuusei (5th Gen) Auditions (September 2007 ~ October 2007)” and the following year, I moved to Tokyo and began living there.</p>

	<p>The reason why I wanted to become an Idol in the first place was because I was in a pretty bad pinch.</p>

	<p>In this chapter, I’d like to talk about the first ever pinch that I experienced when I was in Oita, the place which serves as the start of my “Gyakutenryoku”.</p>

	<h4>Mood Makers and Schemers</h4>
	
	<p>I was born into an ordinary family of 4 including me, my mother, father and my older brother. </p>
	
	<p>It’s really really ordinary. An ordinary mother, and an ordinary father. My brother is perfect though. He’s completely different from me. He has such a bright personality, he’s popular, has a lot of friends - the exact opposite of me.</p>

	<p>My parents are like that as well. They’re very easygoing and have a bright personality as well. The only one with such a screwed up personality is me.</p>
	
	<p>I was really quiet as a kid. Very negative. I didn’t like standing out and I didn’t like seeing others stand out either. I couldn’t care less about the class clowns in my class.</p>
	
	<p>I’m not very good with those kinds of people. Yet now, I’m turned into one myself.</p>

	<p>….I feel like it must have been my parents genes. </p>

	<p>My father is super positive. A happy-go-lucky mood maker. As for my mother, it may have probably been her calculative personality.</p>
	
	<p>In 2012, Kodansha put out a photobook for me called “Sashiko” (publised January 2012). At the end of the book, there’s a letter to me from my mother. At the time, I lived together with her in Tokyo and she told a lie in her letter.</p>
	
	<p>At the end of the letter, she wrote, “I think I am going to return to Oita soon. You’ve showed me just how much you’ve grown”. But after the book came out, she didn’t leave for an entire year! She was enjoying the Tokyo life way too much and didn’t plan on going back at all. She lied to make others feel emotional.</p>

	<p>They say that your personality is determined by your parents. It seems like I’ve inherited the good parts of my parents, my dad’s happy-go-lucky mood maker personality and my mom’s scheming personality.</p>

	<h4>Turning Passion into Motivation</h4>

	<p>I’ve liked Idols ever since I was a kid. I still love them to this day.</p>

	<p>What got me into idols was “ASAYAN”. It’s a famous talent search variety show that I watched when I was in first grade which gave birth to Morning Musume. It was about when “LOVE MACHINE” came out and Gotou Maki was added to Momusu as a third generation member.</p>
	
	<p>The starting point for my passion toward idols was Gomaki. Afterwards, it continued with Kamei Eri (Morning Musume - 6th gen), Hagiwara Mai from °C-ute, Kumai Yurina from Berryz Koubou</p>

	<p>All the other girls in elementary school were also into Momusu. We did things like trade trading cards with friends in the classroom.</p>

	<p>Probably at the time, I liked Idols as much as everyone else. But as I got older, everyone else began liking other things like dodgeball or male Idols. I still liked Idols so I was like “Oh, I guess I’m the only one left”.</p>
	
	<p>In the latter half of my elementary school years, I felt that it starting becoming hard to say that I liked Idols, especially female Idols. I feel like I was able to read those kinds of social cues really early on.</p>
	
	<p>But I like what I like. Even now, I still like everything about Idols from their music to their dances and no matter what others might think, that won’t change. My passion for Idols is what motivates me to continue my activites as an Idol.</p>

	<h4>The World Is Not Just School</h4>

	<p>What really made my passion for Idols snowball was the Internet. Our household received our first computer when I was around second year in elemetary. I guess this is one of those things you would call a real game changer. All the information about Momusu that you normally couldn’t get was all there in the Internet.</p>
	
	<p>You could do stuff like watch videos, look at pictures, read other fan’s blogs and plain text sites. I like to write and I think I’m pretty good at it. I owe all that to the things I read on the internet during that time. The Internet has allowed me to learn about the enthusiasm needed to entertain people through writing.</p>
	
	<p>I started surfing 2Channel in my 5th year of elementary school. As I begain following the links from plain text sites I finally ended up in a pretty deep world.</p>

	<p>I said it pretty frankly but I go on 2Channel. Even to this day. It has a pretty big influence in building my character. Without a doubt.</p>

	<p>Back then, the board that I frequented was the “Morning Musume (Wolf)*” board. At first, I was just there to read what was going on. Then midway, I created a username and began posting myself. Now that I think about it, I was a pretty weird person. There was no one else but that 5th year elementary schooler. Obviously though.</p>
	<!-- BUGBUG -->
	
	<p>From my first year in middle school to the middle of my third year, I ran my own blog. It was a Morning Musume fan blog. There, I was able to be straightfoward about the things I liked and by having conversations in the comments with the people who read my blog continued to grow my passion.</p>
	
	<p>Thanks to the internet during that time, my passion grew and it is definitely connected with the present.</p>

	<p>By plunging myself into the world of the Internet, it made me realize something.</p>

	<p>”The world isn’t just school, it isn’t just Oita”. </p>

	<p>If I’m in a place where things aren’t going well or life isn’t going well, I can just move onto somewhere else. Even if you can’t always be in that special place, if you just keep in mind that there is a place that exists which is different from where you are right now, you’ll feel more easy.</p>

	<p>I feel that those feelings that I had at that time is the basis for my way of thinking now.</p>

	<h4>Computer in the Living Room</h4>

	<p>I am a cold person who always looks at everything objectively. This is completely the Internet’s fault. But somewhere in me, I believe in the kindness of others. Really, I do!</p>
	
	<p>I talked about it more in the last chapter but when I try to think about how I ended up like that, I think it was because of there was this balance between the Internet and family.</p>

	<p>My parents have never been angry at me before. But they weren’t overprotective either. They let me do what I want. I never felt that they were cold towards me, they raised me carefreely.
They don’t stop the things that I wanted to do. Even when I got addicted to the Internet, they didn’t tell me to stop. They never forced onto me things like “the Internet is bad”.</p>

	<p>Now that I look back, it may have been a good idea to be using the computer in our living room since it was a place where I could be seen by my parents. My living room was where, to me, the two places where I could relax overlapped - the Internet and my family.</p>
	
	<p>Recently I think the reason why I’m able to work hard in Tokyo is thanks to my family. No matter tough things are or how hard things get, I can believe that there is a place for me to return to, a place that will, without a doubt, welcome me with open arms.</p>
	
	<h4>I Can’t Forget the Time When I Was Objective</h4>
	
	<p>I think that one of my strong points as an idol is that I myself am originally an Idol wota. I’m confident that no can beat me when it comes to who loves Idols the most.</p>

	<p>That love might have been created when I went to an Idol concert for the first time.</p>
	
	<p>During my fifth year in elementary school, everyone in Morning Musume came to the Grand Theater in Oita (now known as the iichiko Culture Center)!</p>
	
	<p>I begged my mom to accompany me to the concert.</p>

	<p>My seat was on the first floor a little bit on the left side somewhere around the 28th row. I was pretty far in the back but Grand Theater wasn’t a large venue so it wasn’t like members looked like ants from afar. It was incredibly amazing to see a live, moving Gomaki on stage.</p>

	<p>All it took was one concert. You see, there are two types of Idol wota. The first one is the “Zaitaku wota”, the ones that mainly supports their idols from their home. The second are “Genba wota”, the ones who show up at concerts and events. I was completely the latter. There are a lot concerts being performed in Fukuoka, so I finally obtained a ticket after much struggle and rode the limited express train with my mom many, many times….</p>
	
	<p>Now that I’m an Idol, when I see little girls lined up with their moms at the place where they sell concert goods, it makes me feel nostalgic. Sending letters to my favorite idols was something that I also did a long time ago so when I receive fan mail from fangirls, it makes me wonder if they feel the same way I did back then, and if they do, it’d make me really happy.</p>
	
	<p>That’s why once I appear, I hate leaving during the concert and no matter what happens, I will definitely show up. If I was one of the fans coming to concert and the member I supported the most left because of a health related reason, I’d of course get worried but it would suck to come and she’s not there.</p>

	<p>Every person that comes to an event or a concert pays money to come, or gets a day off from work to come, or skips school or club activites to come. As an Idol wota, I was like that too in the past so I know that feeling very well. Because I understand, there is a place where I can do my best in.</p>

	<h4>Linking Dreams and Reality</h4>

	<p>The things that I aspired for back then is now what I do for my job. I think that’s a pretty amazing thing if you calmly think about it.</p>

	<p>By the way, you can’t become an idol by just “ looking up to them”. You have to want to <em>be</em> them. For me, I think AKB48 was what helped give birth to those feelings.</p>
	
	<p>I saw my first AKB48 concert in March during my second year of middle school.</p>

	<p>It was the Fukuoka concert of the “Haru no Chotto Dake Zengoku Tour, ~Mada Mada Daze AKB48!~”  National Tour.</p>

	<p>Of course, there was a lot of information readily available on the internet. The focus of the concert setlist was A4th Tadaima Renaichuu stage songs. “So these are the songs that they perform at the AKB48 theater everyday….”</p>
	
	<p>I thought that was really awesome. And that thought came from me wanting to try going up on stage as well.</p>
	
	<p>I think it’s impossible for me to become an idol but I wanted to try going up on stage and I thought it was something that even I had a shot at. It feels like I had found the path from</p>
	 <!-- BUGBUG page 31 -->

	<p>I felt that dream and reality started to slowly link together. It was just around that time when something happened where I fully realized that I was in a tough situation.</p>

	<h4>If You’re Not Satisfied Where You Are, Gain the Courage To Move Elsewhere</h4>
	
	<p>While the wota life was fun and nice, my school life wasn’t doing so well. The afterschool wind ensemble activites was fun but the classroom wasn’t.</p>
	
	<p> Around my second year of middle school, I was met with light bullying. I’ve been laughed at for no reason by these group of athletic girls as well as insulting me just loud enough so I could hear it and getting ignored on purpose.</p>

	<p>After I became a third year in middle school, it escalated. One day, I received a letter in the mail that said “Just don’t come to school anymore”.</p>

	<p>They must have really hated me if they went as far as giving me a letter. It made me go all like, “Whatever. I’m tired of this”.</p>
	
	<p>I didn’t want to go school anymore so I stopped attending.</p>
	
	<p>I still had a normal, proper life though. I would wake up in the morning, help with household chores at around noontime and then go to cram school around the time that I’d be doing afterschool activities. Even though I stopped attending school, it was strange that I didn’t get into the habit of reversing up my sleep schedule.</p>

	<p>I’m sure my parents were worried about me without me noticing it. But they didn’t try to force me to go to school. They were always like, “If you don’t want to go to school, then you don’t have to go”, always putting my feelings first.</p>

	<p>With that said, on September of my 3rd year in middle school, it became that time where I would have to decide what I wanted to pursue in life.</p>

	<p>“For now, I want to get out of Oita”, was what I was thinking. I wanted to go to a place where no one knew me and start all over again.</p>

	<p>My feelings where like the feelings in the story I told earlier when I dove into the world of the Internet. If I don’t like the place that I’m in now, then I should just relocate to a different place. 
If I could give advice to anyone who is being bullied at school or isn’t doing so well at work, I think it’d be something like that.</p>

  <h4>Becoming an Idol through “Gyakutenryoku”</h4>

	<p>I was good at English in middle school so I told my mom and my teacher at cram school that I would attend the international classes at a local high school and then study abroad from there. But I had secretly applied for the AKB48 audition.</p>
	
	<p>I passed the preliminary application screening. The second part of the audition took place in Tokyo so I told my parents my true feelings.</p>

	<p>“I want to go to Tokyo and become an Idol.”</p>

	<p>As I said earlier, because I dove into the world of the Internet, I understood that “if things get tough, change where you are. Move to another place”. Based on that way of thinking, the idea that the 3rd year middle schooler version of me desperately came up with was to move out of Oita and become an Idol.</p>
	
	<p>I also passed the final stage of the audition. My mom says she supported me but I was worried that my dad who allowed me to take the audition because he thought I wouldn’t pass anyway would be against it at the very end. As I timidly announced the results, he said “Do what you want. As long as your mom goes with you to Tokyo.”</p>
	
	<p>Now that I look back and think about it, any parent would be pretty worried if their daughter who stopped attending school all of sudden says that she wants to go to Tokyo. And on top that, to become an Idol. You’d think they’d once their force their child back to a more proper path. But it was because my parents gave the OK that I am here now.</p>

	<p>I can’t help but feel thankful to both my parents. And also to the all the judges who chose me.</p>
	
	<p>I also want to praise my own courageousness.</p>

	<p>I went from a hikikomori to an Idol. I turned a pinch into chance - my very first “Gyakutenryoku” experience.</p>
